# Tetris-PebbleTime
Tetris for the Pebble Time watch.

I saw that there were some tetris apps available for the Pebble in black and white, and thought it would be nice to have a color version for the Pebble Time.

It's pretty basic, but supports loading interrupted games, pausing, scoring, and levels. It's Tetris, you know the drill.

Added in v1.1-1.3:
- Lots of bug fixes
- High score
- More bug fixes
- Restart after losing without quitting the app
- (Credit: kamotswolf) Option to toggle drop shadows.
